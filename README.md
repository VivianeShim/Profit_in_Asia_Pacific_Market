## Research Question
Asia Pacific Market has the highest sales worldwide but the lowest % of profit. How can we increase the profit margin in Asia Pacific Market?

## Introduction
To answer the reasearch question, we work on price strategy, sales effort strategy and cost strategy.

## Product
 
We could see arts, paper, supplies have the lower sales % but interesting profit margin.
We can increase the volumne of these products to increase our profit margin.

For table and charis, we have a huge margin to increase the price. 

To go deepter analysis, we analzyed the brands. The top 3 profitable brands are Konica, Caridnal and Sauder. The 5 least profitable brands are Bevis, Lesro, Barricks, Chromcraft and Bost. These 5 least profitable brands have negative profit.

The problem we found is that they give many discounts and that affect the profit margin. The average of the discount is $6269.00 and they are giving the discount more than the average.

We also compared the performance of 5 least profitable brand in different market. To compared to Africa Market, we could find out that Boston, Lesro, Chromcraft and Belvis are making positive profit in Africa. We could figure out that the shipping cost and the discount is low in Africa when it's too high in Asia Pacific Market so we should give less discount and change shipping mode to increase our profit.

But, Not all the product of those brand have negative profit. For example, Chromcraft wood table with bottom storage, Chromcrafe conference fully assemble or with adjustable hegiht have positive profit. By comparing the products, we can determine which to keep and which to get rid of. If a product's profit margin is negative, the company is losing money with each unit it sells so we should either drop the product or increse prices. We can also focus more on marketing products with positive profit margin.

We also analyzed the products we give many discount. 

Shipping Cost.
If we analyze the shipping mode and the order priority, We could figure out that shipping cost of 2 days shipping is expensive than the cost of same day shipping. Also, the cost of second class(3 days shipping mode) was much less than the cost of first class(2 days shipping) even if there is one day difference. We should remove the second class on our shipping mode. 

In some countries such as Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, United Arab Emirates and Yemen, we are making negative profit. We should consdier stop selling in those countires or decrease the number of discount.
