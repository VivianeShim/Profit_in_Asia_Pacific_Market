## Research Question
Asia Pacific Market has the highest sales worldwide but the lowest % of the profit. How can we increase the profit margin in Asia Pacific Market?

## Introduction
To answer our research question, we developed a price strategy, sales effort strategy, and cost strategy. The analysis was conducted using Excel and Tableau.

## Price and Cost Strategy

### Product

Art, Binder, Envelopes, Fasteners, Label, Faster and Paper have the lower percentage of sales, but we have the good profit margin.
We can increase the volume of these products to increase our profit.

For tables and chairs, we have a huge margin to increase the price. 

### Brand

To go deeper analysis, we analyzed the brands. The top 3 profitable brands are Konica, Caridnal, and Sauder. 
The five least profitable brands are Bevis, Lesro, Barricks, Chromcraft, and Boston. These five least profitable brands have a negative profit margin.
Brands give too many discounts to customers. There is a huge impact on their profit margin.
The average of discount is $6269.00. These five least profitable brands give the discount more than the average.

We also compared the performance of the five least profitable brands in the Africa market. 
Boston, Lesro, Chromcraft, and Belvis are making a positive profit in Africa.
We could figure out that the shipping cost and the discount are low in Africa so we should give less discount and change shipping mode to increase our profit.

But not all the products of those brands have negative profit. For example, Chromcraft wood table with bottom storage, Chromcrafe conference fully assemble, or adjustable height have positive profit. By comparing the products, we can determine which to keep and which to get rid of. If a product's profit margin is negative, the company is losing money with each unit it sells, so we should either drop the product or increase prices. We can also focus more on marketing products with a positive profit margin.

### Shipping Cost

We also analyzed the shipping mode and the order priority. We could figure out that the shipping cost of 2-days shipping is expensive than the cost of same-day shipping.
Also, the cost of the second class(3-days shipping) was much less than the cost of the first class(2-days shipping), even if there is only one day difference. 
We should remove the second class from our shipping mode.

### Country

In some countries such as Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen, we make negative profits. We should consider stop selling in those countries or decrease the number of discounts. 


## Summary of Proposal
